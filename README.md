# MARSIS (Mars Autonomous Resilient Swarm Intelligence System)

Welcome to the MARSIS project! This repository is currently a **work in progress**, and no functional code exists yet. However, we aim to share our journey building an autonomous, resilient swarm intelligence system designed for harsh Martian environments. Feel free to **watch**, **star**, or **fork** the project in anticipation of upcoming updates.

## Overview
- **Purpose**: Develop a decentralized swarm of "robot actors" capable of withstanding adversarial conditions, byzantine faults, and extreme resource constraints.  
- **Core Tech**: C#, .NET, Akka.NET, blockchain (Libplanet), quantum-resistant cryptography, and generative AI for self-modifying code.

## Roadmap
1. **Phase 1**: Core Simulation  
   - Set up the basic actor system using Akka.NET  
   - Minimal robot actors with simple movement and resource collection  
2. **Phase 2**: Blockchain Integration  
   - Implement an energy ledger using Libplanet  
   - Proof-of-Energy consensus model  
3. **Phase 3**: Byzantine and Adversarial Logic  
   - Introduce malicious actors  
   - Mesh networking with quantum-resistant crypto  
4. **Phase 4**: Self-Modifying Code  
   - Integrate Roslyn and GPT-4 for real-time code evolution  
   - Genetic algorithms to improve energy efficiency  
5. **Phase 5**: Mars Simulation Finalization  
   - Detailed Martian terrain / environment  
   - Full swarm resilience demos against dust storms, solar flares, and sabotage
